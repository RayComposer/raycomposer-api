  *  \brief RayComposer public device API
  *  \version 1.00
  *
  *  This file contains the API definition for the public
  *  RayComposer devices API.
  * \mainpage RayComposer public device API
  *
  * \section Introduction
  *
  * Although RayComposer offers a complete set of tools to create laser shows,
  * some of you asked if they can use the RayComposer laser show devices
  * with their custom (or third party) software. To fulfill your wish, this
  * API (Application Programming Interface) was designed. It allows easy access
  * to the RayComposer devices from most programming languages. Have fun and
  * be creative!
  *
  *  <a href="http://www.raycomposer.de">Copyright &copy;2015 RayComposer - R. Adams</a>.
  *
  * \section Code Example
  * Quick Example in plain C. This code enumerates all devices and displays a list.
  * If a device is found the device will be opened, started and 1000 frames containing
  * a circle will be display. Then the device will be stoped, closed and the program
  * will exit.
  * \include "demo.c"

  * \section License
  * Permission is granted to use this API, the provided samples and documentation free of
  * charge als long as they are used for controling RayComposer devices.
  *
  * Last Update: 18.08.2015
  * Fixing some Documentation typos - RA
