API for RayComposer Laser Show Devices
======================================
Although RayComposer offers a complete set of tools to create laser shows,
some of you asked if they can use the RayComposer laser show devices with their
own (or some third party) software.

To fulfill your wish, this API (Application Programming Interface) was designed.
It allows easy access to the RayComposer devices from most programming languages.
Have fun and be creative!
