API for RayComposer Laser Show Devices
======================================
This API (Application Programming Interface) was designed to allow low-level hardware access to the
[RayComposer ILDA DAC devices](http://www.raycomposer.com) ([RayComposer USB](http://www.raycomposer.de/en/ilda-dac-interfaces/raycomposer-usb/) and [RayComposer NET](http://www.raycomposer.de/en/ilda-dac-ausgabekarten/raycomposer-net/)) from your custom (or third-party)
application software. The API functions only use simple data types to enable compatibility with a large
number of programming languages.

Have fun and be creative!
